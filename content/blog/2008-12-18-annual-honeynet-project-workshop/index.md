Once a year the Honeynet Project brings together members from around the world for a one week workshop on honeyopt research, development and deployments.  We are excited that for this year's event the workshop will be sponsored and hosted by the [International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Threats (IMPACT)](http://www.impact-alliance.org), a public-private alliance against cyber threats.  IMPACT is based in Cyberjaya, Malaysia.  We are very excited for this opportunity as it will be the first time we have hosted the event in Asia.  We would like to thank IMPACT for their sponsorship and their tremendous support both for this event and the Honeynet Project.
