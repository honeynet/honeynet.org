Greetings! First I want to start off by thanking Steve Mumford, Christine Kilger, Jamie Riden, David Watson and Markus Koetter, they are the people that made our new website possible. Second, I wanted to share with you how excited I am about this. One of the challenges we have had for years is coordinating all the different research projects are members are doing. This site will allow each person to share as much as they want, however they want. Expect things like individual blogs, special interest groups and other research areas. Finally I hoping you the community find this website useful as it makes it easier for you to access the information and tools you need. As always, if you have questions or suggestions we would love to hear from you at project@honeynet.org.  
  
Thanks!
