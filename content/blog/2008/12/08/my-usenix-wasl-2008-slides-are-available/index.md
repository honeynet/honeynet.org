I gave a lecture on Picviz during [the Usenix Workshop on the Analysis of System Logs](http://www.usenix.org/events/wasl08/tech/) (WASL 2008).

My slides 'Picviz: finding a needle in a haystack' are [available right here](http://www.wallinfire.net/files/picviz-usenix-wasl2008.pdf).

I also ran for the Cray log analysis contest analysis. Slides of stuff I discovered are [here](http://www.wallinfire.net/files/wasl2008-craylog-contest.pdf).

I lost the contest by 1 vote only, but I was fighting against someone who knew a lot about Cray. He had in my opinion a better talk than mine, but I just started the contest after my morning lecture and I preferred talking with people during lunch than doing the contest ;-)

My discoveries + slides writing took me half an hour (thanks latex+beamer).
