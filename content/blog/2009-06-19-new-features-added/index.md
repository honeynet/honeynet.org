**Hi folks,**

  

It took me a long time to work on the data model, the back-end, to setup all my framework  
(Tapestry+hibernate+Spring+ACEGI+Maven) but it's done right now.

  

So I will post once a week I guess about new features I added.

  

I'd like to speak a bit about how my webapp works. The main goal is to separate every layer of my web.  
e.g front-end/business/back-end :

  

[Layers model

This week, you I added

  

  
- sign up
  
- sign in
  
- add/remove an organization
  
- add/remove honeypots.
  

  

I will be back to France in two weeks, then I'll install CaptureHPC to start thnking about communication between my plateform and a honeypot client.
