The new release 0.5 of Picviz is out. This version comes with real-time mode enabled (and adds the libevent dependency) among other things, such as new properties and variables.  
  
Get it from [the usual place](http://www.wallinfire.net/picviz).  
  
**What is Picviz?**  

  
When considering log files for security, usual applications available today  
either look for patterns using signature databases or use a behavioral  
approach. In both cases, information can be missed. The problem becomes  
bigger with systems receiving a massive amount of logs.  

  

  
Parallel coordinates is an answer to display an infinity of events in multiple  
dimensions. As security data are multivariate, parallel coordinates provides  
a neat way to display and ease abnormal behaviors detection. Picviz implements  
the use of parallel coordinates on acquired data, such as logs, to create a  
parallel coordinates image.  

  

  
Using this image, the analyst can use Picviz to improve the output image,  
filter information and visually detect things.
