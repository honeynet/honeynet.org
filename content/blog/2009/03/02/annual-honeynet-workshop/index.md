Once a year the Honeynet Project brings together members from around the world for a one week workshop on honeypot research, development and deployments.  This year's event was hosted and sponsored by the [International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber-Threats (IMPACT)](http://www.impact-alliance.org/), a public-private alliance against cyber threats.  The event was held in IMPACT's facilities based in Cyberjaya, Malaysia.  Without a doubt, this was our most successful and productive workshop ever.  We had over twenty countries and organizations represented, all dedicated to honeypot development, data collection and analysis.  We would especially like to thank the following people from IMPACT for making this happen.

- Mr. Mohd Noor Amin
- Mr. Azhar Abu-Bakar
- Mr. Anuj Singh
- Mrs. Catherine Westerhout

Terima Kasih!
