We are very excited to announce the Honeynet Project has applied for the Google Summer of Code for 2009. We find that students are often the best source of new ideas and developing cutting edge new technologies.   Having been dedicated to opensource security for over ten years we are strong believers and supports of giving back to the community.  We look forward to the opportunity to work with, mentor and help develop some of the most creative minds on the Internet today.  If you want to learn about information security, and more specifically how to capture and learn about cyber threats, then we have a variety of [exciting project ideas for you](/node/378) .
