We are excited to announce that the Honeynet Project has been selected by Google to be a mentoring organization for their annual [Google Summer of Code project](http://socghop.appspot.com/).  Our team of volunteers is very excited about this and look forward to working with and helping mentor students around the world about honeypot technologies.  To learn more about the different projects you can work with us on, please take a moment to review our [IDEAS PAGE](/node/378).  If you will be submitting an application, your best chance to be selected is to take your time and review and understand the project involved before submitting the application. If you need any additional information or want to ask us questions, you can get in touch by [email](mailto:project@honeynet.org "mail") or on IRC (#gsoc-honeynet on irc.freenode.net).
