Folks, just a friendly reminder that the Honeynet Project is actively seeking and taking students for the annual Google Summer of Code.  If you are interested in information security, open source and learning from some extremely talented developers in this area, then this is the place for you.  We currently have eight project ideas, but we are open to any suggestions or ideas you may have.  Learn more at our [Honeynet Project GSoC Ideas Page](/gsoc).  Applications close on Friday, 03 April so you only have one week left. If you have any questions please contact Lance Spitzner at <lance.spitzner@honeynet.org>.

Thanks, and looking forward to your ideas!

Lance Spitzner
