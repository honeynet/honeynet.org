The Honeynet Project is very excited to be a member of the Google Summer of Code.  We are sponsoring at least [eight GSoC projects](/gsoc) and potentially more, depending on how many other ideas we received.  Google has just closed the application period, we are thrilled to see we received 55 applications.  Our mentors will spend the next week reviewing and ranking each application.  Then, on 15 April Google will select our top applicants.  At this time we do not know how many applicants will be allowed in our program, but we are hoping it will be quite a few! Thanks so much to everyone who submitted an application, we wish you the best of luck! Meanwhile, if you have any questions about our GSoC involvement, join us at irc.freenode.net #gsoc-honeynet

Thanks!
