The results for Google Summer of Code 2009 are out and the Honeynet Project are very excited to have been allocated 9 official slots by Google. You can view the project selection here:  

[http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/honeynet](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/honeynet "GSoC 2009 Slots")  

Congratulations to all the students accepted for GSoC 2009, and commiserations to those who didn't make it this time. We had many more applicants than slots, making the final selection very tough, so we hope everyone who applied will still consider getting involved in open source software and honeynet research. Even if you didn't get an allocated slot, please [get in touch](mailto:project@honeynet.org "Get In Touch") if you would still like get involved. Project mentors and Honeynet Project members may well still be interested in mentoring your project ideas, plus as a volunteer organisation we always welcome new input.  

We'll be posting more information about GSoC 2009 and the Honeynet Project in the [GSoC section of our website](/gsoc "GSoC") and on [our blog](/aggregator "Blog") as things get moving.
