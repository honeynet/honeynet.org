Hi all!

As defined in gsoc proposal the first step was prepare PicViz-Gui to allow change axes order, including add duplicated axes. Even before start the codification process this feature is done. I hope this is a little sinal of we'll have success in all tasks that were defined. See a shot:

axis0, As first and last.
