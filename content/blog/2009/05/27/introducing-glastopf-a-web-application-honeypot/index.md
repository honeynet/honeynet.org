Hello, this initial blog post is used to introduce me and to provide a brief overview of [my GSoC Project](/gsoc/project8 "Glastopf GSoC Project").

My name is Lukas Rist (my personal [blog](http://glasblog.1durch0.de/ "GlasBlog")) and I am currently studying Math and Physics at the [University of Kaiserslauter](http://www.uni-kl.de/ "TU Kaiserslautern")Â in Germany. This is my first time in GSoC and I will be working with [Thorsten Holz](http://honeyblog.org/) on Glastopf, a Web Application Honeypot.

Glastopf is a minimalistic web server emulator written in Python. The honeypot tool collects information about web application-based attacks like for example [remote file inclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_File_Inclusion "RFI"), [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql_injection "SQL Injection"), and [local file inclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection#Include_File_Injection "LFI") attacks.  

The [Glastopf Project](http://trac.1durch0.de/trac/ "Glastopf Trac") was founded before the GSoC, thus a running version of the system is already available. Actually I am improving the central database which holds the collected data from a small number of Glastopf nodes. A big part of my work during the participation will be the analysis of a large amount of collected data. Due to the fact that there is no other tool with comparable capabilities, the first results are astonishing and they are promising a lot of fun in the coming months!

If you are interested in quantitative results from the central database and if you are a fan of fancy Web 2.0 services, check out my Glastopf Twitter feed at [http://twitter.com/glastopf](http://twitter.com/glastopf)
