**Hi everyone,**

  

I just wanted to share few things with you about my project.

  

I'm still very excited to work on my project and if anyone is intersted in what I've done, here is a short tutorial I created to setup the project quickly.

  

If some kind people would like to test it to give me their feedback. It could be the best way for me to improve it.

I share also with you the data model to give you an idea of the first interactions between my plateform and honeypot clients.
