In PCP research, axes reorder is an vital type of analysis. A difficult task is recognize relationships among a small number of variables, specially if those variables were distant in the representation, readjust position of each variable can be interactively explored to improve the graphics and extract more information of them.

  

You could saw this feature was done and how I haven't posted an effective demonstration for readers of honeynet blog yet. With help of my tutor Sebastien, we was created a gif that represents the axes reorder in action.
