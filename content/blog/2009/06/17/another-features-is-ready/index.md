Hi folks! I'm happy cause the work on Picviz Projetct goes well. Another feature was finish, and was determined on our Porposal we are work to improve the Picviz interface.

  

Item 2 from our Proposal, that is ready:

  

2 - Addition features to apply zoom/focus effect in some aspect from graphic;  
  
The density of lines in the PCP can be reduced  
  
dramatically using a focusing tool. Through the implementation of this  
  
feature it will be possible isolate portions of share a value or a  
  
range of values of a particular variable. Focusing the PCP reduce the  
  
visual clutter and remove the lines that are not important to each  
  
observation.

  

And We continue working!! :D
