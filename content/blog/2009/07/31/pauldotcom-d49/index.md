Last week I had the honor of being interviewed by the sharp team at PaulDotCom, in which they quized me extensively about honeypots and honeypot technology.  I have had the chance to work with John Strands of the team, who is one of the best penetration testers I know, he really knows his stuff and creates great demonstration hacking videos.  If you have a chance, check it out, they are smart group of fun guys.
