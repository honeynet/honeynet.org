Since my last update, I've separated the visualizations by IP address, along with adding a few cosmetic additions (lines to the next event in the height different experiment), although there's still a little bit of work to separate that visualization into different IPs.  I've also added camera controls, the basic WSAD at the moment, so that a user can scroll up, down, left, and right, depending on how many host machines there are, as well as how many events there are.  There was also some work on the backend as well, to make the files a little easier to read, as well as adding more comments.  The next tasks I have are completing differentiating the IPs for the height difference visualization, adding more user interface tools, and hopefully trying one or two more visualization types.
