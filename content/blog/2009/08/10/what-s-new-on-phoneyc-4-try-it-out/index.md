Hi all:

  

       I have finished almost all the coding stuff of Project #1, now you can try out the new PHoneyC with shellcode/heapspray detection here:

  

  

[http://code.google.com/p/phoneyc/source/browse/phoneyc#phoneyc/branches/phoneyc-honeyjs](http://code.google.com/p/phoneyc/source/browse/phoneyc#phoneyc/branches/phoneyc-honeyjs)

  

  

        Please feel free to report any bug or suggestion on shellcode/heapspray detection to me.

  
  

  

        As Geng and his partner is still working on the DOM simulation of PHoneyC (Project #2), I will do more test and write an overall introduction to the ideas and structure of the new PHoneyC after merging in his final commit.

  

  

NOTICE: The DOM simulation part of PHoneyC in the svn may change a lot in the following days, so please checkout revision 1433 of the for a stable version.
