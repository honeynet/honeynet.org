_“Dionaea is meant to be a Nepenthes successor, embedding Python as scripting language, using libemu to detect shellcodes, supporting IPv6 and TLS”_ (taken from [Dionaea homepage](http://dionaea.carnivore.it/)). Besides being the most interesting project for trapping malware exploiting vulnerabilities, Dionaea supports a really cool feature which allows it to log to XMPP services as described [here](http://dionaea.carnivore.it/#logxmpp). TIP now exploits this feature receiving and storing such logs (really thanks to Markus Koetter for his help and support). Just an example of what happened today…
