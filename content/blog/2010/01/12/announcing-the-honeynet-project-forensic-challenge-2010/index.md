I am very happy to announce the Honeynet Project Forensic Challenge 2010. The purpose of the Forensic Challenges is to take learning one step farther. Instead of having the Honeynet Project analyze attacks and share their findings, Forensic Challenges give the security community the opportunity to analyze attacks and [share their findings](https://honeynet.org/papers). In the end, individuals and organizations not only learn about threats, but also learn how to analyze them. Even better, individuals can access the write-ups from other individuals, and learn about new tools and techniques for analyzing attacks. Best of all, the attacks of the Forensic Challenge are attacks encountered in the wild, real hacks, provided by our members.

  
  

It has been several years since we provided Forensic Challenges and with the Forensic Challenge 2010, we will provide desperately needed upgrades. The Forensic Challenge 2010 will include a mixture of server-side attacks on the latest operating systems and services, attacks on client-side attacks that emerged in the past few years, attacks on VoiP systems, web applications, etc. At the end of challenge, we will provide a sample solution created by our members using the [state-of-the-art tools](https://honeynet.org/project) that are publicly available, such as libemu and dionaea.

  
  

The first challenge (of several for 2010) will be posted on our [Forensic Challenges web site](https://honeynet.org/challenges) on Monday, January 18th 2010. We will be open to submissions for about two weeks and announce the winners by February 15th 2010. This year, we will also award the top three submissions with prizes! Please check the [web site](https://honeynet.org/challenges) on Monday, January 18th 2010 for further details...
