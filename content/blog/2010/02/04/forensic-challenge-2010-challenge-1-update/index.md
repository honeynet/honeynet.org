Monday, February 1st, the submission deadline for challenge 1 of the Forensic Challenge 2010 has passed. We have received 88 submissions and Tillmann who has been judging them mentioned there were some excellent submissions in the mix. Tillmann will be highlighting some answers when we announce the results on the 15th of February.  
  
I have acknowledged receipt of each submission received via email. If you have not received a confirmation mail from me, please contact me at forensicchallenge2010@honeynet.org and I will check whether we have received it.
