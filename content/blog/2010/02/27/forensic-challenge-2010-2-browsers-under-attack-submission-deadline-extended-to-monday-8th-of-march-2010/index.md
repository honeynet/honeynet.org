We have decided to extend the submission deadline for our second forensic challenge - "browsers under attack" to Monday, 8th of March 2010. This gives you another week to participate in our latest challenge. Subsequently, the announcement of the results will also move another week to Monday, 22nd of March 2010. 

I have contacted all the folks that have already submitted their solution to us about this change. They, of course, have the opportunity to resubmit their solution, if they so wish, until the new submission deadline on the 8th. (If you have submitted and did not receive an email from me, please contact us at forensicchallenge2010@honeynet.org)  

Challenge 2 focuses on browser attacks and can be accessed at [Forensic Challenge 2010/2](https://honeynet.org/challenges/2010_2_browsers_under_attack). The top 3 submissions will be awarded prizes.
