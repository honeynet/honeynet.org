Folks, its a frosty Tuesday morning in Seattle and the deadline for submissions to the forensic challenge 2010/2 "browsers under attack" has passed. We received a total of 34 for submissions from folks all over the world. Nicolas from the Singapore chapter will be judging the submissions in the next few days. We will announce the top three winners on Monday, 22nd of March 2010. Alongside, we will post their submissions as well as our sample solution. Since we were using a web form for this challenge, we will not acknowledge receipt of each submission. If you are unsure whether submission was successful, please email forensicchallenge2010@honeynet.org and we can check the submission database.) Also, if you have any suggestions on how to improve the forensic challenge, please let us know.

PS: Forensic Challenge 2010/3 is currently being prepared. In this challenge, a memory dump needs to be analyzed...so a bit different from our past couple of challenges that focus on network traces....I hope to see many submissions on it. We expect to post it Tuesday, 23rd of March 2010...
