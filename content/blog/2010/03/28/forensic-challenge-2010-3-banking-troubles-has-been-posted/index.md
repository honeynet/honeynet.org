[Challenge 3](https://honeynet.org/challenges/2010_3_banking_troubles) of the Honeynet Project Forensic Challenge - titled "Banking Troubles" - is now online and we invite you to participate. Challenge 3 - provided by Josh Smith and Matt Cote from The Rochester Institute of Technology Chapter, Angelo Dell'Aera from the Italian Chapter and Nicolas Collery from the Singapore Chapter - is a bit different from our previous challenges in that we do not ask you to analyze a pcap network trace, but rather a memory image from a virtual machine. This should make for an interesting challenge!  
  
Submission deadline is April 18th and results will be released on Wednesday, May 5th 2010. Small prizes will be awarded to the top three submissions.  
  
Enjoy!
