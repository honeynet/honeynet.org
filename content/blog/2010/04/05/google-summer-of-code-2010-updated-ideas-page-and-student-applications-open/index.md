On March 29th Google officially began accepting applications from students for [Google Summer of Code 2010](http://socghop.appspot.com), which the Honeynet Project is very exicted to be participating in again this year as a [mentoring organisation](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2010). We've recently updated our [project ideas page](/gsoc/ideas) and mentor information and students have until 19:00 UTC on Friday April 9th to apply (you can either chose one of our ideas or propose your own).  

If you are interested in applying to be a student and you haven't already said hello on **#gsoc-honeynet** on **irc.freenode.net** then please pop by if you have any questions. Most people find speaking to a project mentor before they apply helps them understand more about what is required to write a good application and we are always happy to answer questions (although please remember that since our members come from [chapters all round the world](https://www3.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/projectmap.jpg) it might take a few hours for someone to respond.  

Further information from Google is available on their [blog post](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/03/students-apply-now-for-google-summer-of.html) announcing the program, along with the [program timeline](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs#timeline).  

We are looking forward to receiving some great applications again this year...
