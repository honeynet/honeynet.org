Folks, we have decided to extend the submission deadline of the Forensic Challenge 2010/3 - "Banking Troubles" for another week (deadline is now April 26th 2010.) Seems like this challenge is a bit tougher and we would like to give you all the opportunity to submit your results. For those folks that have already submitted, you can resubmit via the web form in case you would like to make changes to your solution. The Forensic Challenge 2010/3 can be accessed here: [https://honeynet.org/challenges/2010\_3\_banking\_troubles](https://honeynet.org/challenges/2010_3_banking_troubles).
