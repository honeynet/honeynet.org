Folks, the submission deadline for our [Forensic Challenge 4 - VoIP](https://www.honeynet.org/challenges/2010_4_voip) is quickly approaching. The deadline is this Wednesday and so you have another 4 days to submit your solution.  

The challenge is quite different than our previous challenges. It was provided by Ben Reardon from the Australian and Sjur Eivind Usken from Norwegian Chapter - and takes you into the realm of voice communication on the Internet. Thanks to our Chinese speaking chapters, it is also available in simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese.  

Small prizes will be awarded to the top three submissions and we will announce results approx 3 weeks from now. Would be great to see your submission!  

Christian
