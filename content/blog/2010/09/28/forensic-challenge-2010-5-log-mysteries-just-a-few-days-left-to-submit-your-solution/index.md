The deadline for the Forensic Challenge 2010/5 - Log Mysteries is quickly approaching. It seems like this challenge is a hard nut to crack as we only received a few submissions so far. If you like a challenge, give it a try. The deadline is September 30th 2010. You can access the challenge at [https://honeynet.org/challenges/2010\_5\_log\_mysteries](https://honeynet.org/challenges/2010_5_log_mysteries). Did I mention there are prizes?
