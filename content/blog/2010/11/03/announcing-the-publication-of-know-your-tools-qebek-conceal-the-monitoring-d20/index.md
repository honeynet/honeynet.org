I am very pleased to announce another publication of our Know Your Tools series: Qebek - Conceal the Monitoring authored by Chengyu Song and Jianwei Zhuge from the Chinese Chapter and Brian Hay from the Alaskan Chapter.  
  
The paper is available from [https://honeynet.org/papers/KYT\_qebek](https://honeynet.org/papers/KYT_qebek).  
  
Paper abstract  
For the last few years, while low-interaction (LI) honeypot systems like Nepenthes and PHoneyC are getting more and more powerful, the progress of high-interaction (HI) honeypot technology has been somewhat slower. This is especially true for Sebek, the de-facto HI honeypot monitoring tool. In this KYT paper, we introduce Qebek, a QEMU based HI honeypot monitoring tool which aims at improving the invisibility of monitoring the attackersâ€™ activities in HI honeypots.
