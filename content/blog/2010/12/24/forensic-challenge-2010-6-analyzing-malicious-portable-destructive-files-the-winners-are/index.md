Folks, holiday greetings from forensic challenge headquarter in Seattle. Mahmud and Ahmad from the Malaysian Chapter have judged all submissions and results have been posted on the challenge web site. The winners are:  
  
1. Vos from Russia with perfect score!  
2. Codrut from Romania  
3. Mike from Canada  
  
Congratulations!  
  
We received a total of 21 submissions and they were very competitive. The top three submissions came within a point of a perfect score and Vos from Russia actually received a perfect score. We have posted the top three submissions from Vos, Cordut and Mike on [the challenge web site](https://honeynet.org/challenges/2010_6_malicious_pdf) . As I said, these submissions are top notch and I encourage you to read through them.  
  
With the forensic challenge 2010 coming to an end, we will be taking a little break for the holidays, but will be back in full force in early 2011. 
  
Happy Holidays.  
  
Christian Seifert
