Folks, Chengyu Song has been busy the last few weeks and made some upgrades to the honeypot monitoring tool Qebek. He has ported it from QEMU 0.9.1 to QEMU 0.13.0. As a result, Qebek's performance (boot time) is better and it no longer requires gcc 3.4. You can check it out  

`svn co https://projects.honeynet.org/svn/sebek/virtualization/qebek/trunk/`

If you don't know what Qebek is or how to use it, take a look at our whitepaper at [https://honeynet.org/papers/KYT\_qebek](https://honeynet.org/papers/KYT_qebek).
