Here is another new release from the Project: a release of a new tool called [PhoneyC](https://www.honeynet.org/project/PhoneyC), a virtual client honeypot.  
PhoneyC is a virtual client honeypot, meaning it is not a real application (that can be compromised by attackers and then monitored for analysis of attacker behavior), but rather an emulated client, implemented in Python. The main thing it does is scour web pages looking for those that attack the browser.  
It can be run, for example, as: _$ python phoneyc.py -v_ [_www.google.com_](http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=www.google.com)  
By using dynamic analysis, [PhoneyC](https://honeynet.org/project/PhoneyC) is able to remove the obfuscation from many malicious pages. Furthermore, PhoneyC emulates specific vulnerabilities to pinpoint the attack vector. PhoneyC is a modular framework that enables the study of malicious HTTP pages and understands modern vulnerabilities and attacker techniques.
