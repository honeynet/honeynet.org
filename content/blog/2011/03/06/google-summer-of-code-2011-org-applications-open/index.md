Has it really been another year already? Having really enjoyed our experience as a successful mentoring organization in [Google Summer of Code 2009](/gsoc2009) and [Google Summer of Code 2010](/gsoc2010), The Honeynet Project is very pleased to announce that we will once again be applying to be accepted this year as a potential mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code 2011](http://www.google-melange.com/) (note the changed URL for GSoC 2011).  

The first GSoC 2011 deadline is [Friday March 11th](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline), which is the deadline for interested organizations to submit their org application. Currently we are reviewing our [GSoC 2011 project ideas](/gsoc/ideas) internally and prospective students will soon be able to see our list of proposed project ideas [here](/gsoc/ideas). If we are accepted this year by Google, as usual all of our GSoC 2011 information will be available at [/gsoc](/gsoc) on our main public website.  

To provide some background, you can find a copy of a [recent presentation](https://www3.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/GSoC-2009-2010_Honeynet_Project_David_Watson.pdf) by our Chief Research Officer David Watson on our achievements during GSoC 2009 and GSoC 2010 [here](https://www3.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/GSoC-2009-2010_Honeynet_Project_David_Watson.pdf). This hopefully provides a quick introduction to the Honeynet Project and a summary of our collective activities in recent GSoCs.  

For more GSoC 2011 information, student enquiries and GSoC mailing list information, see our [/gsoc](/gsoc) site.  

Fingers crossed for lots of interesting student projects and another productive summer...
