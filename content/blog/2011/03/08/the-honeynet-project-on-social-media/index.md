Not all of you might know it, but The Honeynet Project is well-represented on social media. Apart from [this blog](https://www.honeynet.org/blog), we have:

- An official Project Twitter feed [@projecthoneynet](http://twitter.com/projecthoneynet)
- [Facebook group 'The Honeynet Project'](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7847102937)
- [LinkedIn group 'The Honeynet Project'](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=888767)
- [“Old school” public mailing list, still at SecurityFocus](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/119)

Finally, if you consider IRC to be social media (and why not?), we still run these:  

#honeynet-project on irc.freenode.net (new, general public enquiries)  

#honeynetproject on irc.freenode.net (new, general public enquiries)  

Pick your favorite channel and follow us there!

Or, suggest where else we should be "playing"!
