About the event:  
  
The 2011 Project Honeynet Security Workshop brings together experts in the field of information security from around the world to share the latest advances and threats in information security research. Organized by the not-for-profit Honeynet Project and co-sponsored by the ESIEA Engineering School, this full day workshop creates opportunities for networking, collaboration and lessons-learned featuring a rare, outstanding line-up of international security professionals who will present on the latest research tools and findings in the field.  
  
This year’s workshop will be held in Paris, France on 21 March 2011 and is the first time that the workshop has opened a day to the public. Starting at 9:00 GMT+1, the workshop program features a format that includes presentations in five sessions and two bonus hands-on activities. The bonus activities include a technically challenging capture-the-flag (CTF) session and a tough forensics challenge (FC) that will allow attendees to apply their expertise and compete for prizes. If you’re looking to attend a high quality and challenging security workshop, then we encourage you to take advantage of this rare opportunity.
