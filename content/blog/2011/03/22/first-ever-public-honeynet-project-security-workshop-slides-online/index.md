Folks, we had a great day at the first-ever public Honeynet Project Security Workshop yesterday with many excellent presentations by our members from around the globe. The presentations ranged from deep technical dives around shellcode detection and mobile malware reverse engineering to views on social dynamics of attackers and ethics of computer security research.  

Further, we hosted a small capture-the-flag/forensic challenge competition, which received plentiful participation - especially with the younger crowd.  

We hope that everybody enjoyed the workshop. If you were not able to make it to the workshop this year, we have attached the slides to this blog post. Hope to see you again in 2012. 

Christian Seifert  
CEO, The Honeynet Project
