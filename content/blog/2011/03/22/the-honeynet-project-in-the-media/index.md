The Honeynet Project has been all over the media again lately, mostly due to our visualization research. Ben Reardon ([@benreardon](http://twitter.com/benreardon)) from [Australia Honeypot Project](https://honeynet.org.au/) **[VOIP honeynet visualizations appeared](https://honeynet.org.au/?q=node/67)** on [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/2011/03/08/visualization-of-an.html), [Geek.com](http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-cetera/voip-hacker-attack-gets-visualized-20110311/), [SmartPlanet](http://www.smartplanet.com/technology/blog/thinking-tech/dramatic-video-hacker-vs-computer/6534/), [ThreatPost](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/image-day-visualizing-voip-server-attack-031411) and [ZDNet France](http://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/infra-net/interessante-visualisation-animee-d-une-cyber-attaque-sur-un-serveur-de-voip-39758972.htm) as well as on many other media venues.

However, the highest profile showing was in the ["New Scientist"](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/nstv/2011/03/born-to-be-viral-computer-fights-hacker-attack.html) , leading to more then 100,000 views!
