Our [annual workshop in Paris](https://www.honeynet.org/node/626) got off to the perfect start this weekend when Google went live with the [new look GSoC 2011 Melange site](http://www.google-melange.com) and announced which lucky organizations had been [accepted as mentoring orgs for GSoC 2011](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011).  

The Honeynet Project were delighted to have been successful again this year and to have been accepted as one of 173 organizations who will be mentoring GSoC 2011 student projects this summer! Many thanks go to Google for their continued support for FOSS (particularly the ever supportive Carol), and to all our members and potential students for their interest, support and enthusiasm so far.  

We'll be holding a number of internal GSoC 2011 sessions during the coming week of our workshop, including reviewing project ideas and providing support for potential project members, and hopefully we'll have many members and mentors on both **#gsoc2011-honeynet** on **irc.freenode.net** IRC and on our [public GSoC mailing list](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc).  

Student applications open on [Monday March 28th at 19:00 UTC](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline) and run through to [Friday April 8th at 19:00 UTC](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline) so if you are a student interested in participating in GSoC 2011 with the Honeynet Project, please take a look at our [GSoC 2011 project ideas](/gsoc/ideas) and find more information about getting involved.  

We are looking forward to hearing from your and enjoying another exciting summer of code again this year :-)
