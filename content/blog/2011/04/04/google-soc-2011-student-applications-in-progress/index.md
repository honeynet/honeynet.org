With [GSoC 2011 student applications](http://www.google-melange.com) having been open for the past week, we've been having a number of interesting discussions with potential students on both **#gsoc2011-honeynet** on **irc.freenode.net** and on our [public GSoC mailing list](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc) and this summer is already looking to have many exciting project ideas.  
  
Student applications run through to [Friday April 8th at 19:00 UTC](http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline), so if you are a student interested in participating in GSoC 2011 with the Honeynet Project, please take a look at our [GSoC 2011 project ideas](/gsoc/ideas) and make the most of the remaining time to get involved. We cover a very wide range of projects, tools and technologies, so hopefully there is something available to interest everyone, whatever their experience.  
  
If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know on **#gsoc2011-honeynet** on **irc.freenode.net** or on our [public GSoC mailing list](https://public.honeynet.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc).  
  
Looking forwards to hearing from prospective students before Friday...
