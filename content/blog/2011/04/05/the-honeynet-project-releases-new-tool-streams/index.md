Tillmann Werner from the Giraffe Honeynet Project chapter just released the first version of "streams", a tool for browsing, mining and processing TCP streams in pcap files. If you ever needed to process large pcap files on a session level, you will love this tool. Have a look at the README to get an impression of its  
capabilities.  
  
The [README](http://src.carnivore.it/streams/about) contains some sample output and tool description.  
  
Tillmann's talk ["High Performance Sniffing"](https://www3.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/sniffing-mining.pdf) from The Honeynet Project public workshop covers this tool:  
  
The latest code can always be downloaded from [the git repository](http://src.carnivore.it/streams/tree/)  
  
Tarballs of the recent version can be downloaded [here](ftp://ftp.carnivore.it/projects/streams/)  
  
As always, feedback is more than welcome!
