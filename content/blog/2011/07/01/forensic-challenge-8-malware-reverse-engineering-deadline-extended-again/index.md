We are realizing that the Forensic Challenge 8 - "Malware Reverse Engineering" - is really difficult to solve because right now we received just 5 submissions. For this reason we decided to extend the submission deadline again to July 31th.  
  
Those who already submitted a solution before June 30th are granted the possibility to submit again thus taking advantage of this one-month extra time. Moreover a few extra bonus points will be assigned to them.  
  
Have fun!
