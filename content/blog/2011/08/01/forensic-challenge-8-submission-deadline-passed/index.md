Folks,

We have received 6 submissions and will be announcing results on Wed, Aug 31th 2011. The top three submissions will be awarded little prizes.  

For your information a new Forensic Challenge will start in a few hours. This time you will be asked to dive into the mobile malware world. Stay tuned!
