We build up a project in google code, you can browse AxMock by the link  
[http://code.google.com/p/axmock](http://code.google.com/p/axmock/)  
  
AxMock is a detection tool for malicious webpage attacking ActiveX controls. It runs in Internet Explorer 7 and the formal version.  
  
It is tested in Visual Studio 2008 and Python 2.6 with pywin32 package, though I believe that you can also compile it in later version.  
  
For more using information, please check out Wiki in my project google code page.  
  
Have fun with it. :) And it is appreciate of you to leave comments here or send email to me, which is baoyouzhipku \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com.
