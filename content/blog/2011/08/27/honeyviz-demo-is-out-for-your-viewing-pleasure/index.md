We've set up a demonstration site for HoneyViz (Project #3) at

http://50.16.162.188:6174/

HoneyViz is an interactive java applet which visualizes sensor data (similar to Project #4). The goal of this project has been to allow the end user to select a set of data that is of interest and generate a variety of useful visualizations based off of this selection in realtime.

The site offers some user-level documentation to explain how the tool works and provides suggestions for a few interesting visualizations we have found. Although, the best way to become familiar with the tool is simply to play with it – select different sets of events, make menu or color changes, select regions on the map, etc.

Questions, comments, and suggestions can all be directed toward the [_Contact Me_](http://50.16.162.188:6174/feedback.html) page. Enjoy the demo and I hope everyone's project went well!
