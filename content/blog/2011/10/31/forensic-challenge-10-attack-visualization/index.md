I am pleased to announce the next forensic challenge: [Forensic Challenge 10 - "Attack Visualization"](https://www.honeynet.org/node/781).  

The challenge has been created by Ben Reardon from Australia Chapter.  

Submission deadline is December 18th and we will be announcing winners around the last week of January 2012. We have a few small prizes for the top three submissions.  

Have fun!
