We are proud and happy to announce that a new free malware analysis online service is born.  

Malwr.com is based on Cuckoo Sandbox, a project mentored by the Honeynet Project, sponsored by GSoC and developped by Claudio "nex" Guarnieri (@botherder), Dario Fernandes and Alessandro "jekil" Tanasi (@jekil). Malwr.com hosting is provided by ShadowServer.  

If you want to test Cuckoo's flavor before installing it or if you're too lazy to deploy your own sandbox, just go there ! :-)
