We have just been notified by Google that the Honeynet Project has - once again - been accepted as one of the mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2012 (in total 180 organizations were selected). We are very excited and are looking forward to a great summer! Already a big thank you to Google for their continued support!  

While student applications are not officially open yet, interested students are encouraged to check out our [ideas page](https://honeynet.org/gsoc/ideas) and get in contact with us via [gsoc@public.honeynet.org](mailto:gsoc@public.honeynet.org) and/or IRC (#gsoc2012-honeynet on irc.freenode.net) in the next few ideas to meet the mentors and discuss project ideas. Student applications officially open on March 26th 2012 and close on April 6th 2012. 

We are looking forward to hearing from you!
