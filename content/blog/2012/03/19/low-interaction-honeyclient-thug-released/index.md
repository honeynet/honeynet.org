I'm glad to announce I finally publicly released a brand new low-interaction honeyclient I'm working on from a few months now. The project name is **Thug** and it was publicly presented a few hours ago during the Honeynet Project Security Workshop in Facebook HQ in Menlo Park. Please take a look at the (attached) presentation for details about Thug.  
  
Just a few highlights about Thug:  
  

  
- DOM (almost) compliant with W3C DOM Core and HTML specifications (Level 1, 2 and partially 3) and partially compliant with W3C DOM Events and Style specifications
  
- Google V8 Javascript engine wrapped through PyV8
  
- Vulnerability modules (ActiveX controls, core browser functionalities, browser plugins)
  
- Currently 6 IE personalities supported
  
- Hybrid static/dynamic analysis
  
- MITRE MAEC native logging format
  
- HPFeeds and MongoDB logging
  

  
  
The source code is available [here](https://github.com/buffer/thug).  
  
Feedback and comments welcome.  
  
Have fun!
