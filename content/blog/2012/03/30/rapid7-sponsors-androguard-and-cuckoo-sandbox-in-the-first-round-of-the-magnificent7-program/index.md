We are proud and happy to announce that Cuckoo Sandbox and AndroGuard were choosen by Rapid7 for his Magnificent7 Program, an initiative created to fuel the success of seven bleeding edge open source projects and backed by a fund of $100,000. 

Cuckoo Sandbox and AndroGuard are respectively developped by Claudio Guarnieri and Anthony Desnos and mentored during previous GSoC.  

Congratulations to Claudio and Anthony !
