Good evening/morning folks.  
  
It's been fairly busy here at HNP HQ for a number of reasons. That said, there were a number of interesting articles over the weekend I thought I'd hilight here for your reading pleasure. This week seems to be a week of malware so we will stick with that theme.  
  
[STORIES ABOUT BOTNETS - PART 1](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2012/06/stories-about-botnets-part-1.html)  
  
  
  
[Malware Hunting with the Sysinternals Tools (video)](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012/SIA302)  
  
  
  
[Obfuscation #2: Playing entrypoint hide & seek game with dyld](http://reverse.put.as/2012/02/07/obfuscation-2-playing-entrypoint-hide-seek-game-with-dyld/)  
  
  
  
[Malware Unpacking Level: Pintool](http://jbremer.org/malware-unpacking-level-pintool/)  
  
  
  
Yes, we have posted [this](http://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.de/p/malware-analysis-tutorials-reverse.html) link a few times via our [Twitter](http://twitter.com/projecthoneynet) stream, but it's a fantastic series of posts on  
malware analysis from a reversing point of view so it's worth posting again in case anyone doesn't  
follow us on Twitter.  
  
Please feel free to send us your feedback.
