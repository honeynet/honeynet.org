Another Monday has been and gone (on this side of the world at least). I thought I'd sit down again and share some of the interestingness (yes, that's a word now) that came through my various news feeds over the course of the weekend.

There's an interesting series of articles on Rootkit technologies starting [here](http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/securitycenter/whitepapers/an-analysis-of-rootkit-technologies-part-1)  
  
The more than awesome folks over at NoStarch have released a sample [chapter](http://nostarch.com/download/rootkits_ch2.pdf) (pdf) of the upcoming book "Designing BSD Rootkits": Practical Hooking techniques"  
  
  
I'm sure there's more out there, but that will do for now.
