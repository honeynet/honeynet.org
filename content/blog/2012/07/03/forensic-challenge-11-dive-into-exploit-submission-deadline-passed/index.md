Folks,  
the submission deadline for the Forensic Challenge 11 "Dive Into Exploit" created by Georg Wicherski from Giraffe Chapter has passed.  
  
We have received 2 good submissions and will be announcing results before the end of July. Without doubt, this challenge was one of the most difficult ones the Honeynet Project provided in the last years so we are really glad about the submitted solutions which seems really high-level at a first glance.
