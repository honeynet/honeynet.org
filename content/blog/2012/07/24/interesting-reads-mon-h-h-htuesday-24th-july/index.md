Good morning folks  
  
My apologies for the delay on this one. It appears the the wily coyote has passed on his tricks to my Internet connection and as such I've been offline for a fairly large portion of time. No matter....onward to the readables !!  
  
  
  
**Malware**  
  
  
An in-depth code analysis of mssecmgr.ocx from the [ESET](http://blog.eset.com/2012/07/20/flame-in-depth-code-analysis-of-mssecmgr-ocx) folks is here.  
  
  
  
The Virus Total crew are bringing some seriously cool features to VT. More [here](http://blog.virustotal.com/2012/07/virustotal-behavioural-information.html)  
  
  
  
The SANS diary has a short but great article on diagnosing malware with Resource Monitor [here](http://isc.sans.edu/diary/13735). They're also worth following on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/sans_isc) if you don't already.  
  
  
  
**General Goodness**  
  
  
  
There seems to be quite a few people taking advantage of [Cuckoo](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/). There's a very cool post on adding ClamAV and Yara signatures to it [here](http://hiddenillusion.blogspot.no/2012/07/customizing-cukoo-to-fit-your-needs.html). Definitely worth having a look at.  
  
  
  
Recently at [Hitcon](http://hitcon.org/2012/) there was a talk by @osxreverser on OS X Malware which was worth looking [at](http://reverse.put.as/Hitcon_2012_Presentation.pdf) (pdf). Hopefully they will publish the videos for it in the near future...  
  
  
  
  
There's probably a bunch more out there, but that should be enough to get you started on your Mon^H^H^HTuesday morning...  
  
Have a good one folks..
