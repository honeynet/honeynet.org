As the GSOC approaches the end. I would like to publish a beta version of my project for Network Malware Simulation.

The name for the new open source software is Imalse, which is the acronym of **I**ntegrated **MAL**ware **S**imulator & **E**mulator

The website for the project is [http://people.bu.edu/wangjing/open-source/imalse/html/index.html](http://people.bu.edu/wangjing/open-source/imalse/html/index.html), in which you can get detailed description, instructions for installation and demos.

I recorded two videos which are available at [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ91McFlIvo&feature=relmfu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ91McFlIvo&feature=relmfu) and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSXyEXFRSYs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSXyEXFRSYs)

The ultimate goal of Imalse is “Write once, Run Everywhere”. You can just write one copy of code for Malware Simulation(Now I focus on botnet based malware) and it can run at different levels of abstraction, from complete simulation to real testbed.

I would like to thank Hugo González, my mentor in the Google Summer of Code and [Yannis Paschalidis](http://ionia.bu.edu/), my advisor in Boston University for their support in the past summer.

The project is under development for only three months so it is far from mature. Any suggestion is welcome. Just drop me an email, my email address is wangjing A\_T bu.edu
