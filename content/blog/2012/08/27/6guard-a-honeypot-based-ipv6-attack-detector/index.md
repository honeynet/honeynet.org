6Guard is a honeypot-based IPv6 attack detector aiming at detecting the link-local level attacks, especially when the port-mirror feature of switch is unavailable.

### **Intallation**

1. 1. Download and install [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) in your machine. (`apt-get install python-scapy`)
1. 1. Download the [v1.0 tarball](https://github.com/mzweilin/ipv6-attack-detector/tarball/v1.0) directly or the latest code from [Github Repository](https://github.com/mzweilin/ipv6-attack-detector/), then extract it into a directory.
### **Usage**

1. 1. Enter the directory of 6Guard.
1. 1. Run `$ sudo ./conf_generator.py` to generate the configuration files.
1. 1. Run `$ sudo ./6guard.py`.

_Note_: The `./conf` directory stores the configuration files of the honeypots and the globalpot. The `./log` directory stores the operation logs and the attacking records. The `./pcap` directory stores the message-related packets that can be reviewed in Wireshark.

### **Detection Capability**

6Guard is able to detect most attacks initiated by [THC-IPv6](http://thc.org/thc-ipv6/) and the advanced IPv6 host discovery methods utilized by [Nmap](http://nmap.org/). In practical terms, this beta version could detect the attacks as below:

**Group I of THC-IPv6. Fake Router Advertisement or Redirect ICMPv6**

- fake\_router6
- flood\_router6
- kill\_router6
- redir6

**Group II of THC-IPv6. Fake Neighbour Solicitation/Advertisement**

- dos-new-ip6
- parasite6
- fake-advertise6
- flood\_advertise6
- flood\_solicitate6

**Group III of THC-IPv6. Fake DHCPv6/DNS Server or Client**

- flood\_dhcpc6

**Group IV of THC-IPv6. Evil Consumer For Network resource or CPU resource**

- rsmurf6
- smurf6
- sendpees6
- sendpeesmp6

**Advanced IPv6 host discovery utilized by Nmap**

- targets-ipv6-multicast-echo.nse
- targets-ipv6-multicast-invalid-dst.nse
- targets-ipv6-multicast-slaac.nse

### **Architecture**

![](images/drupal_image_942.png)

6Guard is based on Python and Scapy. Basically, it contains the three modules: honeypot, globalpot and event analysis.

The _honeypot_ is a virtual low-interaction IPv6 host with the capability of NDP and StateLess Address Auto-Configuration. Consequently, it is responsible for detecting the unicast attacks.

The _globalpot_ is a module focusing on detecting the multicast attacks. Since each honeypot would be able to capture the multicast attacks at the same time, then implementing the feature as a globalpot would simplify the detection significantly.

The _event analysis_ module is responsible for analyzing the Event messages and generating an Attack message if detected. Such mechanism is useful for detecting attacks like dos-new-ip6: when one honeypot reported an _Event_ message that the address was in use, it might be true, but if more honeypots reported the address-in-use message, we could know that the network was suffering dos-new-ip6 attack.

Consequently, the _Attack_ messages comes from the _honeypots_, the _globalpot_ and the _event analysis_ module.

### **Detecting Examples**
