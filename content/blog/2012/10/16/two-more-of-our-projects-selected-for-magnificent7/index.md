Rapid7 have [announced](http://www.rapid7.com/news-events/press-releases/2012/2012-second-round-magnificent7-program.jsp) the selected projects for the second round of their Magnificent7 program. The program sponsors open source efforts in the area of IT security over the course of a year and provides them with Rapid7's technological and marketing expertise.  
  
In March, [Cuckoo](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/) and [Androguard](http://code.google.com/p/androguard/) - both developed by members of the Honeynet Project - were chosen, and today's press release revealed two more of our members' projects to be supported under the Magnificent7 program.  
  
[Buttinsky](http://buttinsky.org/), led by Patrik Lantz and Lukas Rist, will be a framework for botnet monitoring built from scratch. [Ghost](http://code.google.com/p/ghost-usb-honeypot/), led by Sebastian Poeplau, protects against malware that spreads on USB storage. We also congratulate the developers of [John the Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/), which is the third project to be selected today.
