Spartan Devils Chapter Status Report For 2012  
  
ORGANIZATION  
  
Our current membership includes: Gail Joon Ahn (Arizona State University) Tom Holt, (Michigan State University) Max Kilger, and Napoleon Paxton, We are also happy to report that we added Paul Neff to our roster in the last few months.  
  
DEPLOYMENTS  
In addition to all tools from honeynet site, we also installed Sandboxie on Vmware ESXi to automatically test malware and reset VMs.  
  
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  
We are currently working on a range of social and technical research projects. Gail and his students in the process of developing a tool for automated social network analyses of forum and other web-based data sources. Tom and Max are developing models to examine the predictors of willingness to engage in attacks against government resources on and off-line using behavioral and attitudinal measures related to political and social outlook, as well as perceived support for involvement in cybercrime. Finally, Tom is developing models to explore the factors affecting the price of stolen data sold in on-line forums, including the seller’s support for customer service and the country of origin for the data.  
  
FINDINGS  
We were able to publish the first KYE paper in several years providing an updated exploration of the social dynamics of the hacker/attacker community over the summer (available at https://honeynet.org/papers/socialdynamics). Additionally, we have begun to publish initial findings from our "cyberwarrior" project that attempts to identify attitudinal and behavioral predictors for willingness to engage in cyberattacks against government targets. The first of these publications appeared in the journal Crime and Delinquency in September. We are in the process of combining our US data with data collected in Taiwan and Southern Africa as well.

GOALS  
  
We met all of the goals we set for the previous year. Specifically, we have begun to establish infrastructure for malware analysis at ASU. We have also identified resources to expand our data collection capabilities at MSU. In addition, we identified collaborators who enabled us to collect data for the cyberwarrior project in Taiwan and Southern Africa. Finally, we have published several articles from our research.  
  
Our goals for the upcoming year include:  
1) seeking and acquiring external funding for malware and hacking research  
2) expanding our analysis of attacker/hacker communities  
3) better integrate our social and technical research  
4) publish various articles and books from our research  
5) add several members to our chapter rolls from across the social sciences to develop a truly interdisciplinary chapter.
