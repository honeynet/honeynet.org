**2013 HONEYNET PROJECT ANNUAL WORKSHOP**  
**10-12 FEBRUARY 2013 IN DUBAI, UAE**

DUBAI, 26 NOV 2012: This three-day event features an exceptional collection of international security professionals presenting the latest research tools and findings in malware analysis. The twelfth annual workshop will be held at The Address Dubai Mall Hotel on the 10th through 12th of February, 2013, with sponsorship and support from the UAE Honeynet Project chapter, United Arab Emirates Computer Emergency Response Team (aeCERT), and the Pakistan Honeynet Project chapter. The workshop includes one full day of briefings and two full days of hands-on tutorial trainings. Founded in 1999, The Honeynet Project is a non-profit international research organization dedicated to improving the security of the Internet at no cost to the public.

“Cyber security is a critical element for any nation working towards technical advancement,” said H.E. Mohamed Nasser Al Ghanim, Director General of TRA. “I am pleased the TRA and aeCERT are participating in this event; hands-on and knowledge-intensive workshops such as this are invaluable as we work towards reinforcing the nation’s cyber security.”

“Cyber security is not a ‘one-man’ job, it is dependent on the proactive collaboration of groups spanning government, industry and academia,” said Ahmad Alajail, Security Intelligence & Threat Analyst. “This is why initiatives such as Honeynet, which provide a diverse talent base, are greatly complementary to the nation’s cyber security and to our work at aeCERT.”

The Honeynet Project is composed of 45 regional chapters and is a diverse, talented, and engaged group of hundreds of volunteer security experts who conduct open, cross disciplinary research and development into the evolving threat landscape.
