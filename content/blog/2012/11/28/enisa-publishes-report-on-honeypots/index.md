ENISA (The European Network and Information Security Agency) under the leadership of CERT Polska has published report on honeypots. Its a hands-on guide on the various honeypot technologies out there looking at various operational aspects, such as extensibility, reliability, ease of deployment, etc. If you are considering running a honeypot, this is a must read! Check it out at [http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new-report-by-eu-agency-enisa-on-digital-trap-honeypots-to-detect-cyber-attacks](http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new-report-by-eu-agency-enisa-on-digital-trap-honeypots-to-detect-cyber-attacks).
