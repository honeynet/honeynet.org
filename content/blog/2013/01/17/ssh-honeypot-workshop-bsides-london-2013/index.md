At the last BruCON conference in Ghent last year I had the pleasure to talk to Soraya (Iggi), Bsides London co-organizer. She convinced me into submitting a workshop proposal for the Bsides London 2013. 
  
And guess what, it got accepted.  
  
So I will be doing a workshop on setting up a basic kippo SSH honeypot from Upi Tamminen (http://code.google.com/p/kippo/) and if time permits, using Ioannis Koniaris (Ion) kippo visualization tool kippo-graph (http://bruteforce.gr/kippo-graph).  
Bsides London will be held on April 24th 2013 at Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall  
  
Hope to see/meet/talk and share drinks !  
  
Cheers,  
  
Leon van der Eijk
