After a tense few days for all of the organizations who applied, The Honeynet Project is delighted to announce that it has once again been [selected as one the participating mentoring organizations](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/honeynet) in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013). This is great news and should make for another very exciting summer for many students, mentors and team members, so many thanks to Google's and their Open Source Projects Office for their continued support of both us and free open source software (FLOSS) in general. We all really appreciate the support :-)  
  
Google [officially announced](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/04/mentoring-organizations-for-google.html) the list of 177 mentoring organizations at 19:00 today (Monday April 8th), and you can find the full list of participating organizations on the [main GSoC 2013 site](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013) (which may take a couple of days to be fully populated as each accepted organization needs to submit their own public profile information before they are all displayed there). Google received 417 org applications this year and selected 177 mentoring orgs, compared to 180 of 406 in 2012, so a slightly reduced percentage of selected organizations this year and still a fairly competitive process, with no doubt many disappointed orgs out there today. Commiserations to all those people who didn't get selected this year.  
  
The next [GSoC 2013 milestone dates](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) are student applications officially beginning on [April 22nd](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) at 19:00 UTC and closing on [May 3rd](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) at 19:00 UTC. However, if you are an [eligible GSoC student](https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page#1._Are_there_any_age_restrictions_on) who is interested in doing GSoC 2013 with The Honeynet Project, we'd definitely encourage you to make contact with us (and apply through [Melange](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013)) sooner rather than later.  
  
**Getting In Touch:** GSoC 2013 information, contact details and background information can be found [here](/gsoc) and [here](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/honeynet), while potential project ideas can be found [here](/gsoc/ideas). If you have any questions about GSoC 2013 or the Honeynet Project in general, please get in touch.  
  
Thanks to Google's continuing generous support, we are very much looking forwards to hearing from potential students, and finding out what great projects we can do together. It should be another very interesting summer.
