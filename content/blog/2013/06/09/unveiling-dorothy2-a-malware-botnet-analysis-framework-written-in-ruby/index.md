Howdy all,  
I've the pleasure to \*finally\* unveil the second version of Dorothy: a malware/botnet analysis framework written in Ruby.  
  
Dorothy2 is a framework created for mass malware analysis. Currently, it is mainly based on analyzing the network behavior of a virtual machine where a suspicious executable was executed. However, static binary analysis and system behavior analysis will be shortly introduced in further versions.  
Dorothy is a multi-thread framework: it is able to execute as many concurrent analysis processes as the number of the VMs present in vSphere. So if you have 5 VMs for example, 5 binaries will be analyzed at time, by giving you 5 different output folders containing their network traffic and screenshots accordingly.  
It is a very modular framework, and customizing/extending it can be very easy.  
  
For more details, refer to its [README](https://github.com/m4rco-/dorothy2/blob/master/README.md)  
  
  
During the last years Dorothy2 helped me in several analysis/research on botnets and I  
really hope that can now be useful to someone else.
