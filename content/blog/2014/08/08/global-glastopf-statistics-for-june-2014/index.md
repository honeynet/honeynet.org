**10 most popular injected files during the period**

Short introduction to RFI:

“Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a type of vulnerability most often found on websites. It allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script on the web server. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation. This can lead to something as minimal as outputting the contents of the file or more serious events such as: Code execution on the web server .. “ source: Wikipedia

**And a few findings that we found extra interesting**

**TimThumb Remote Code Execution: webshot**

**About**

TimThumb is a small php script for cropping, zooming and resizing web images (jpg, png, gif).

**Exploitation**

`http:///wp-content/themes//path/to/timthumb.php?webshot=1&src=http:// $()`

**WordPress Pingback.ping DDoS attempts**

**About**

pingback.ping, is a legit WordPress feature misused to DoS victims using legit WordPress sites.

Please see the URL below for more information about this vulnerability **URL** http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/03/more-than-162000-wordpress-sites-used-for-distributed- denial-of-service-attack.html

**Exploitation**

`pingback.pinghttp://victim.com www.anywordpresssite.com/postchosenparam>'`

**Victims per category**

In an attempt to visualise the type of targets for these attacks we took the help of the public available resource: sitereview.bluecoat.com to categorise the targeted sites

![](images/drupal_image_1182.png)

Many of the sites categorised as not yet rated by the webfilter vendor, ended up being sites offering DDoS services, many of them protected by legit DDoS protection services.

**WordPress wp.getUsersBlogs brute force attempts**

**Comment** We were able to quickly detect wp.getUserBlogs attempts when they "started", now a month later there are several blog post describing the issue.

The first occurrences detected was on the 29:th of June, targeting only a limited amount of Honeypots and originated from two European countries.

**About** "This attack is being made possible because many calls in the WordPress XMLRPC implementation required a username and password. It these attacks, we are seeing wp.getUsersBlogs being used (and very few times wp.getComments), but it could be other calls as well. If you provide a user and a password to them, it will reply back if the combination is correct or not:" sucuri.net

Please see the URL below for more information about this vulnerability **URL** http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/new-brute-force-attacks-exploiting-xmlrpc-in-wordpress.html

**Exploitation** `wp.getUsersBlogs admin112233`

**Passwords**

The list is quite long, so here is a small sample

<table><tbody><tr><td>password</td><td>melody</td><td>master</td></tr><tr><td>gogogo</td><td>"name of the domain"</td><td>admin</td></tr><tr><td>12345678</td><td>trustno1</td><td>test</td></tr><tr><td>secret</td><td>reset123</td><td>qwerty123</td></tr><tr><td>pass</td><td>fuck</td><td>audrey</td></tr><tr><td>admin123</td><td>1qaz2wsx</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><td>12345</td><td>123456</td><td>123456789</td></tr><tr><td>1111</td><td>zaq12wsx</td><td>yellow</td></tr><tr><td>wisdom</td><td>winter</td><td>windows</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Summary**

This was a small excerpt from the collected data. I hope this encouraged you to continue to have hpfeeds enabled (or to enable it, if you have turned it off) on your honeypot/honeypots as the data gives a very valuable insight into current threats globally.

**System reference:**

“Glastopf is a Honeypot which emulates thousands of vulnerabilities to gather data from attacks targeting web applications. The principle behind it is very simple: Reply the correct response to the attacker exploiting the web application.”
