This blog post is the first of a two-part series in response to the Wired article of Oct 14, 2014, "[How Microsoft Appointed Itself Sheriff of the Internet](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/microsoft-pinkerton/)." \[McM14\] I find some problems with this article that raise questions about the depth of research into some elements of the story, and an appearance of bias in how "unintended consequences" are presented.
