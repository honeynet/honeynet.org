With winter in the northern hemisphere beginning to turn into spring, it is once again time to think about summer. And of course, for many open source organizations, that means [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1 "GSoC 2015").

After successfully participating in GSoC between 2009 and 2013 to create or extended many honeynet technologies that have gone on to become industry standard tools, we are very happy to annouce that The Honeynet Project has applied to be a mentoring organization in GSoC 2015.

Google will be announcing the list of lucky selected mentoring organizations on [March 2nd](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2015). Until then, you can find everything you should need to know in the new [GSoC 2015 section of our public website](/gsoc "GSoC 2015"), including our list of [potential student project ideas](/gsoc/ideas "GSoC 2015 project ideas") and how to get in touch with us.

Fingers crossed that we will be talking to lots of interesting students about exciting summer projects once again in a few weeks time!
