Kai Roer is focusing on user awareness, security culture and the study of how our human mind makes us vulnerable and exploitable. He consults with people and organizations on the interpersonal skills that are vital to a successful and trusted secure environment. He is the creator of the Security Culture Framework, a columnist at Help-Net Security and the author of a number of books about cybersecurity and leadership. His latest book is "Build a Security Culture".

**1) What was your motivation to enter Information Security field, and who inspired and** **helped you along the way?** 

_I entered this field more by necessity than by choice. Working in the void between technology,_ _communication and leadership, I soon realized how information security in its wider definition_ _is key to control information in all channels, and as such a key to communication and thus_ _leadership. There are a great number of inspirators out there, people I consider both mentors_ _and friends. As is not uncommon in our industry, I prefer not to name names, just point out_ _that there are a lot of extremely smart people around the world who contribute to the security_ _community in a number of ways. If you do insist on a few names, look up some of the books I_ _have co­authored, and who else did write in those books._ 

**2) How do keep yourself motivated in this line of work and how do you handle the competition & failures?** 

_I am probably an odd­ball in the infosec community in that I am not a technically skilled_ _hacker, nor am I particularly interested in tech. What I do, and do very well according to_ _clients and connections, is to understand how the human mind impacts our security_ _behaviors, and by understanding the mind, I help advice on programs and actions to change_ _security behavior into the kind of behaviors we want to see from people. I am a strong believer_ _in intrinsic motivation, and have created the Security Culture Framework as a free and open_ _method to build security culture and change security awareness, because by allowing anyone_ _access to the framework, we allow any organization to understand how to build and maintain_ _the kind of security culture they need. And by doing so, instead of creating a competing_ _environment, we enable the community to learn from each others. And seeing the results_ _emerging in organizations around the world, organizations who may never have been able to_ _hire my services, now being able to help themselves to better security ­ that is a great_ _motivation for me personally, and to the community._

**3) Why is Global Honeynet Project important and why should people support this cause?** 

_Just like the Security Culture Framework, the Honeynet Project started, and thrives, as a_ _community driven project focused on spreading understanding and building knowledge about_ _how hackers infect and destroy systems. Before the Honeynet project, you were almost on_ _your own, while with the Honeynet Project you now have a huge, global resource of people_ _who understand your issues, and can help you understand how to protect yourself better. I_ _strongly believe community driven projects are powerful bodies of knowledge that people_ _should support and join. It is, however, important to understand how motivation works ­and_ _what motivates yourself. If you find the areas of the Honeynet project of interest to you (and_ _reading this, I think you may do that!), joining the cause will help you spread your knowledge,_ _help you learn more, build a global network of people who understand and care for the same_ _area of interest, as well as enabling you to personal growth._

**4) What is your talk about and why people should join the event?** 

_My talk Hacking Your Mind, is an exploratory drive true three basic psychological phenomena_ _that makes the human hackable and subsequently, and exploitable. These phenomena are,_ _possibly, hard­wired into our brains, and as such, we need to understand how they work in_ _order to build up our defenses. My talk explains each of the three areas and how social_ _engineers of all sorts use these to trick us into doing things. Delivered with my passion, this is_ _a must­not­miss talk for anyone who needs to understand how to combat social engineering_ _and to secure the so­called weakest link._

**5) What Security issues are being exploited and how to counter them?** 

_A very wide question, don’t you think? I will narrow down to my area of interest: the human_ _mind and social behavior, or security culture as I normally call it. Within security culture, there_ _are a number of security issues taking place ­ from social engineering to the insider threat._ _The biggest challenge is that after almost two decades of training and security awareness_ _focus, security awareness programs generally fail. There are number of reasons for this ­both_ _on the local organization side, as well as systemic reasons. But perhaps most importantly,_ _programs fails because information security people do not understand how people function._ _So instead of adapting the programs to the needs of the people they are trying to change,_ _they focus on creating change where none is wanted ­ the users do not understand the very_ _basic WHY, the reason for the change you expect them to make. And yet, most information_ _security officers in charge of awareness do not change their own perception of how to train_ _people. Instead they conclude like this: "People are stupid. Awareness trainings do not work"._ _Guess what. You are wrong. People are not stupid (well, most of them). And awareness_ _programs fail not so much because of the programs, but due to their failure to understand_ _their own requirements to adapt to the needs of the target audience. Again, this is the major_ _reason behind the creation of the Security Culture Framework, which helps the security officer_ _to understand how to build and maintain security culture that actually yields results._

**6) What are the gaps in today’s security methods?** 

_Everywhere? Methods evolve, change and adapt to the current situation, as they should._ _Perhaps the biggest challenge is when methods no longer change, evolve and adapt? When_ _we continue to do what we always did, yet we expect new results. Again, consider the security_ _awareness focus, which the general consensus is that it does not work. If so, why do you_ _continue to do the same old programmes all over again? And again? If it does not get you the_ _results you need, get rid of it, and try something else! Just like the true hackers does!_

**7) What are your suggestions for upcoming professionals?** 

_Never forget the human aspect of information security. And stop blaming the humans for the failures of security. Build secure systems which work together with humans to be secure, not something that works against every human behavior. To learn more about humans, security culture and security behavior, look up the Security Culture Framework (​https://scf.roer.com​). ­It is free and open, and consider joining peers in Oslo in june 2015 for the Security Culture Conference (https://scf.roer.com/conference​). Perhaps even more important ­talk to your heros, your rock­stars, your motivators, the speakers at the conference. Most of them are very kind, caring and knowledgeable people who want to help you. Network (with people), be humble, and never give up._
