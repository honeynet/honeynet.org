Marie has a Ph. D. in information security and  is passionate about incident handling and information sharing. She has experience as a team leader at NSM NorCERT, the Norwegian national CERT. Marie also teaches a class on incident management and contingency planning at Gjøvik University College.

  

**What was your motivation to enter Information Security field, and who inspired and helped you along the way?**

  

I didn't intend to become an infosec professional, I just let my interest, talent and curiosity lead me along the way. When I started university I chose maths and physics because I had been to an educational fair and talked to a cool lady with a degree in bio-physics who did research on how to cure cancer. Then I discovered that I had more talent and interest in mathematics than in physics and I ended up doing my master thesis on algebra and crypto-analysis, which was really fun! A very inspiring professor in algebra, prof. Idun Reiten, was one reason that I went in that direction. I wanted to do a Ph.D., but not in abstract algebra as that quickly became a little bit too abstract for me. I was then lucky to get a Ph.D. position at the Telematics department doing infosec research, and that was what brought me into this field.

  

**How do keep yourself motivated in this line of work and how do you handle the competition &amp; failures?**

  

I have a strong inner motivation to learn new things and to take on challenges. If someone gives me the choice between two tasks I will always go for the more difficult task. My career so far has taught me how little I know and at the same time how to gain access to the know-how that's needed. I love to collaborate with others and to be part of a strong team. As a woman in a male-dominated field I have the advantage of standing out and being noticed, this can of course go both ways. Sometimes it can be fun to surprise people that have a certain perception about women in IT, other times it can be boring to always answer to the same questions and misconceptions.

  

**Why is Global Honeynet Project important and why should people support this cause?**

  

The Honeynet Project aims at making the Internet a more secure place by learning about attack methods and developing open-source tools, what is not to like about that?

  

**What is your talk about and why people should join the event?**

  

My talk is about incident handling, with the perspectives from a national CERT focused on combating digital espionage.

  

**What Security issues are being exploited and how to counter them?**

  

Technical, organisational and human vulnerabilities are being exploited by a wide range of attackers. To counter this we need to build security in to our systems and processes in all these aspects. This is a very challenging task and that is why we should also be focused on detecting and responding to incidents. Collaboration and information sharing is also a very important part of this, we need to stand together as a security community to be able to face this global threat.

  

**How does your talk impact today’s security scenario?**

  

I hope to give the audience some new insights into incident response based on lessons learned from various intrusions where NorCERT had a role in the incident coordination.

  

**What are your suggestions for upcoming professionals?**

  

Work hard, stay curious, join the security community and do not be afraid to engage into conversations and ask "silly questions".
