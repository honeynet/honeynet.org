Hello,

  

  

recently I published forks of [shockpot](https://github.com/GovCERT-CZ/shockpot) and [wordpot](https://github.com/GovCERT-CZ/wordpot) on GitHub. 

  

These new versions include support for logging to postgresql database. I also created two frontends. One for shockpot with a name Shockpot-Frontend and second for wordpot with a name Wordpot-Frontend. Both frontends are based of great tool Kippo-Graph. You can find them also on GitHub. Links are [github.com/GovCERT-CZ/Shockpot-Frontend](https://github.com/GovCERT-CZ/Shockpot-Frontend) and [github.com/GovCERT-CZ/Wordpot-Frontend](https://github.com/GovCERT-CZ/Wordpot-Frontend).

  

These frontends require data from honeypots stored in postgresql database and that's why I made forks of those honeypots.

  

I think that some one could use that so I write this post. 

  

I plan to publish more improved honeypots in the near future.

  

  

Have a nice day,
