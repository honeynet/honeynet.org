Hello,

  

  

recently I made fork of dionaea and DionaeaFR. Changes that I did are related with remote logging to relational database. Dionaea honeypot can now log remotely to postgresql database. In DionaeaFR frontend I had to do some changes, so it could support reading data from postgresql.

  

Links are [github.com/GovCERT-CZ/dionaea](https://github.com/GovCERT-CZ/dionaea) and [github.com/GovCERT-CZ/DionaeaFR](https://github.com/GovCERT-CZ/DionaeaFR).

  

I think that some one could use that so I write this post.  

  

  

Have a nice day,
