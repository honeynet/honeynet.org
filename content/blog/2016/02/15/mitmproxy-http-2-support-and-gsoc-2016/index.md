We are happy to announce the immediate availability of [mitmproxy 0.16](https://mitmproxy.org/)! As a major new feature, Thomas Kriechbaumer – who joined us as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Student last year – contributed a brand new HTTP/2 implementation built on top of [hyper-h2](https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2). HTTP/2 requests now blend into the mitmproxy UI just like regular HTTP 1 requests, making mitmproxy the first interactive HTTPS proxy with HTTP/2 support! All HTTP/2 features from RFC7540 are supported - including PUSH\_PROMISE, RST\_STREAM, and as many concurrent streams as you want. We are super excited about the improvements Thomas is bringing us here and we encourage you to try them out. To make a transition as seamless as possible, HTTP/2 needs to be enabled manually for now by passing `--http2` to mitmproxy. We plan to remove this requirement with one of the next releases. For a full list of changes, take a look at the changelog posted below!

### Google Summer of Code 2016

2012 was a big year for me - being only just out of my freshman year, Honeynet accepted my application as a GSoC Student and I got introduced to the world of free and open-source software development and started contributing to mitmproxy. Long story short, I think this program is one of the major reasons why I am now writing this blog post as one of mitmproxy’s core contributors. Last year, I was in the fortunate position to mentor a student myself - we’re super happy that not only Thomas’ project was a great success, but we also gained a very strong new mitmproxy contributor who is contributing well beyond his GSoC. I am very happy to announce that we are applying under the umbrella of Honeynet as a GSoC Organization this year again. The last six years’ projects have generated long-lasting successes at Honeynet, so we can’t wait to get in touch with students this year again!
