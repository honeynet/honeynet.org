Although it is still winter in much of the northern hemisphere, for students and open source software developers, the gradually lengthing days mean that spring will soon be with us - and of course that means another chance to potentially get involved in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1 "GSoC 2015").

After successfully participating in GSoC between 2009 and 2015, and having created or extended many honeynet technologies that have since gone on to become industry standard tools, we are very happy to annouce that The Honeynet Project has applied to be a mentoring organization once again in GSoC 2016.

This year sees some changes in the GSoC program, with a new internal co-ordinator at Google, a new backend [management system](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ "GSoC Management System") (no more Melange), revised org/student application processes plus some changes to the program rules.

Google will be announcing the list of lucky selected mentoring organizations on [February 29th](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline "GSoC 2016 Timeline") at 19:00 UTC. Until then, you can find everything you should need to know in the new [GSoC 2016 section of our public website](/gsoc "GSoC 2016"), including our list of [potential student project ideas](/gsoc/ideas "GSoC 2015 project ideas"), a new section of [GSoC Student Application Tips](/gsoc/tips "GSoC Application Tips") plus details of how to get in touch with us.

If you want to see examples of the kind of projects and experiences gained by last years successful students, check out:

- [Adding OSX support to Cuckoo Sandbox](https://honeynet.org/node/1275 "OSX Cuckoo Sandbox")
- [Android hooking using ARTDroid](https://honeynet.org/node/1285%20 "ARTDroid")
- [Adding HTTP2 support in MITMProxy](https://honeynet.org/node/1304 "PEEPDF")
- [Adding new capabilities to peepdf](https://honeynet.org/node/1304 "PEEPDF")

So until then, happy background reading, and fingers crossed that we will be talking to lots of interesting students about exciting summer projects once again in a few weeks time!
