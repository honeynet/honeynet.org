As I [blogged two weeks ago](https://honeynet.org/node/1309 "GSoC Application"), after some great student projects between 2009 and 2015, The Honeynet Project had applied again this year to be a mentoring organization in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-search=honeynet "GSoC 2016").

After a few anxious days of waiting, Google today published the official list of [accepted GSoC 2016 mentoring orgizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/ "GSoC 2016 mentoring orgs"). The great news if that we have been accepted once again. Hurrah!

[GSoC 2016 student applications](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/ "GSoC 2016 student applications") open on [March 14th at 19:00 UTC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline "GSoC 2016 Timeline") and close on [March 25th at 19:00 UTC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline "GSoC 2016 Timeline").

In our experience, the students who make the most succesful student applications and projects tend to start getting in contact early, so if you are an [eligible student](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq "GSoC 2016 FAQ") who is interested in working on an exciting information security development project with The Honeynet Project, please visit the [GSoC 2016 section of our website](https://www.honeynet.org/gsoc "GSoC 2016") to find more information about how to proceed.

Thanks once again to Google for giving us the opportunity to support student open source development, and to everyone involved so far in making this happen. We are very much looking forwards to hearing from you, and starting what will no doubt be another exciting and productive summer.

Potential students - please put your thinking hats on, and happy GSoC-ing... :-)
