After successfully participating in GSoC between 2009 and 2016, and having created or extended many honeynet technologies that have since gone on to become industry standard tools, we are very happy to annouce that The Honeynet Project has applied to be a mentoring organization once again in GSoC 2017.

This year sees significant changes in the GSoC program with a new payment model and an added third evaluation! We are excited about those changes and very curious to see how they play out. In addition to the program changes at Google, we are also trying out some ways to improve our students’ experience. Most notably, all our potential mentors have already joined the new [GSoC Slack channel](https://gsoc-slack.honeynet.org/) and we are excited to talk to you there!

Google will be announcing the list of lucky selected mentoring organizations on February 27th. Until then, you can find everything you should need to know in the new [GSoC 2017 section](https://honeynet.org/gsoc2017/) of our public website, including our list of [potential student project ideas](https://honeynet.org/gsoc2017/ideas), our [GSoC Student Application Tips](https://honeynet.org/gsoc2017/application-tips) plus details of how to get in touch with us.

If you want to see examples of the kind of projects and experiences gained by last years successful students, check out:

- [Mitmproxy Web UI](https://honeynet.org/gsoc2016/slot7)
- [Mitmproxy Core](https://honeynet.org/gsoc2016/slot8)

So until then, happy background reading, and fingers crossed that we will be talking to lots of interesting students about exciting summer projects once again in a few weeks time!
