This is a contribution by GSoC student Ziyue Yang, find him on Github [yzygitzh](https://github.com/yzygitzh).

My project for GSoC 2017 is [Android Sandbox Detection and Countermeasure](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4820206829436928), which came out to be the **ReDroid** toolbox. This post was presented for the final evaluation of my GSoC 2017 project.

ReDroid is a toolbox for **automatically detecting and countering** anti-sandbox behaviors in Android apps. You can:

- [View source on GitHub](https://github.com/yzygitzh/ReDroid)
- [Download as zip file](https://github.com/yzygitzh/ReDroid/archive/master.zip)
- [View usage example](https://yzygitzh.github.io/android/2017/08/29/redroid-usage.html)

Before GSoC 2017 begins, my GSoC mentor Yuanchun Li discussed with me about the proposal for the GSoC project. Generally our goal was to develop some mechanism that can **counter anti-sandbox techniques presented in Android apps**.

First, We raised three related research questions to solve:

1. What sandbox-detection techniques are applied in Android apps, and how and to what extent are they applied? 
2. Is there a method capable of detecting such sandbox-detection techniques given a sample app?
3. Is there an app analysis solution undetectable by common sandbox-detection methods?

After that, we came out with a plan with three stages:

1. _Investigating and collecting sandbox-detection techniques used in Android app_ (especially malware), and implementing a sample app using those techniques.
2. _Implementing a **detection-aware system**_, which can identify whether an Android app has sandbox-detection techniques inside.
3. _Implementing an **undetectable system**_. Such undetectable system is able to automatically find the detection activities inside an Android app, and convey countermeasures for them using data collected from 2). In such a system, an app would believe that it’s running on as a real device.

| Tasks |     Status     | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   
Investigating and collecting sandbox-detection techniques used in Android app |   
Done |   
Investigated [anti-emulator](https://github.com/yzygitzh/anti-emulator), [DenDroid](https://github.com/yzygitzh/dendroid_apk) and a malware dataset provided by [contagiominidump.blogspot.com](http://contagiominidump.blogspot.com/) |
|   
Implementing a detection-aware system |   
Done |   
Modified Android source to enable robust and automatic trace collection; Implemented a runtime trace collecting system based on [DroidBot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot) and a heuristic trace difference detection system |
|   
Implementing an undetectable system |   
Partly  
Done |   
Implemented a dynamic control flow correction system based on JDWP and [Xposed](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811), which is capable for modifying method return values; Modified Android source to enable dynamic control flow correction without known by apps |

# Future work:

1. _Support more complex method return types_: currently ReDroid only supports return values of primitive types and `String` type.
2. _Support more advanced method hooking_: currently ReDroid only supports hacking methods according to stack trace, and the methods hacked can have only one return value.
3. _Wrap ReDroid to make it usable for most people_: to run ReDroid, one has to configure real device and emulators, which is much too complicated for normal users. ReDroid can be wrapped into a cloud service in the future.
