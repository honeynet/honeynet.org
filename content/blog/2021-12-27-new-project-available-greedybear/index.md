This year has been a Christmas more tough than usual for a lot of people. The Covid pandemic is rising again all over the world, the security analysts are facing one of the worst ever found software vulnerabilities (referring to Log4j CVE-2021-44228), and so on.

With the goal to help all the community during these hard times, recently we have been working to a new project, called **GreedyBear**, that you can find on [Github](https://github.com/honeynet/GreedyBear).

### A ... greedy ... bear?

Yes. Bears. Greedy Bears. They love honey and [honeypots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)). And these ones are particularly _greedy_. They want all the honey for themselves...

Joking apart, we have been running a cluster of [TPOTs](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce) for a while but we struggled to find a way to share the data collected to the community. The new project comes at this point, with the aim to collect the information from the TPOTs and generate some **actionable feeds** that can be easily leveraged by all the community as a free source of valuable information to prevent or detect attacks.

Right now the data is collected from 2 specific honeypots: [Log4Pot](https://github.com/thomaspatzke/Log4Pot) and [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie). More to come.

Please check out the Github page to get all the details on [how to retrieve](https://github.com/honeynet/GreedyBear/blob/main/README.md) and [how you can use](https://github.com/honeynet/GreedyBear/blob/main/FEEDS_LICENSE.md) the feeds.

### Future

This is just the _alpha_ version of GreedyBear. Our plans are to evolve this project over time and propose it for the upcoming [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/organizations/5942967122001920) of the year to come. If you wish to contribute, please join the [Honeynet Slack Channel](https://gsoc-slack.honeynet.org/).

So stay tuned for the next updates! And stay safe during the holidays!
