The Honeynet Project has appointed **Ali Ikinci** as the new CEO. 

We wish to thank Faiz Ahmad Shuja for leading the project over the past years, and welcome Ali for accepting the challenge. 

Founder and current leader of the Turkish Chapter, Ali is a longtime Honeynet Project member and contributor: he co-authored research papers on malicious website detection with low-interaction honeyclients and on honeypots for the Internet of Things. Born and raised in Germany, Ali is also an established professional in the Information Security field, with broad experience as a Chief Security Analyst, Product Manager, Senior IT consultant and Entrepreneur.

Leading The Honeynet Project through our next chapter, Ali’s vision and experience will prove invaluable as we work to develop new projects and share our work with the information security community.
