Our dedicated Google Summer of Code (GSoC) participant, [Abheek](https://twitter.com/abheekblahblah), has spent an impressive three-month duration program actively contributing to not one, but two distinct projects: [IntelOwl](https://intelowlproject.github.io/) and [Buffalogs](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs). Notably, Abheek undertook the responsibility of crafting the brand-new official website for IntelOwl throughout this period.

In light of this significant achievement, we believe it is only fitting to showcase his remarkable results and contributions within the official IntelOwl site, in which he discuses his journey as a designer/frontend developer, the tasks involved and the detailed contributions to both projects, including the revamping of IntelOwl's website, implementing JWT authentication for Buffalogs, creating maps and graphs for BuffaLogs' dashboard, and crafting a frontend guide for IntelOwl using react-joyride.

We invite you to explore the comprehensive summary of Abheek's GSoC 2023 journey in our [official project blog post](https://intelowlproject.github.io/blogs/gsoc23_project_summary), and hope you find it a valuable resource to gain deeper insights into Abheek's accomplishments during the program and how it has helped strengthen his commitment to open-source.
