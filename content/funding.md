The Honeynet Project is committed to improving the security of the Internet at no cost to the public. We do this in the research and development of new tools and providing information on security threats so individuals and organizations can better protect themselves. However, as these threats grow, develop and advance, so to must we. This requires additional resources. If you would like to contribute or partner in ourÂ  research programs, email us at project@honeynet.org. We will accept funding from private and public sector organizations, individuals and non-profit groups only on the condition the funding can be used for research that is free to the public.
