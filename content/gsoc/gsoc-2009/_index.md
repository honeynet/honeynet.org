- We are an enthusiastic and passionate volunteer dedicated to the ideals of open source and sharing ourÂ  security research and development knowledge with the community
- For ten years, we have pioneered research in the field of honeypots, releasing many freely available [tools](/project "tools"), [challenges](/challenges "challenges") and [Know Your Enemy whitepapers](/papers "kye") that are often considered groundbreaking when first published
- We literally wrote the [book](http://old.honeynet.org/book "book") on the topic, and regularly [present](http://www2.honeynet.org/wp-content/uploads/attachments/PacSec07_David_Watson_Global_Distributed_Honeynet.pdf "pacsec") on our R&D activities at conferences all over the world
