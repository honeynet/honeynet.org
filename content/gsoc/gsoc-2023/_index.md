### We are applying again to be a mentor organization for GSoC in 2023

This will be the 14th time that Honeynet is participating in the Google Summer of Code program to accelerate the creation of information- and cyber security related tools that are free and open source software. Thank you to all mentors who submitted their project ideas and will volunteer as mentors throughout the summer.

On this page you will learn more about GSoC 2023 and our efforts on developing and improving our projects.

### Project Ideas

### Organizational Administrators

Our GSoC 2023 organizational administrators this year are:

- Lukas Rist (lead)
- Maximilian Hils
- Emmanouil Vasilomano

### Why get involved with the Honeynet Project?

1. We are an enthusiastic and passionate group of volunteers dedicated to the ideals of open source and sharing our security research and development knowledge with the community
2. For over ten years, we have pioneered research in the field of honeypots, releasing many freely available [tools](//www.honeynet.org/project), [challenges](//www.honeynet.org/challenges) and [Know Your Enemy whitepapers](//www.honeynet.org/papers) that are often considered groundbreaking when first published
3. We literally wrote the [book](//old.honeynet.org/book) on the topic, and regularly [present](//old.honeynet.org/speaking/PacSec07_David_Watson_Global_Distributed_Honeynet.pdf) on our R&D activities at conferences all over the world
4. We have [active](//www.honeynet.org/node/371) volunteer member [chapters](//www.honeynet.org/og) in many countries and from many different backgrounds, with a wide variety of skills and experience they are happy to share
5. We have always been committed to the concepts of open source software and freely share everything we do, including each chapter publishing regular public [status reports](//www.honeynet.org/chapter/statusreports) on their recent activity
6. We maintain active public and private communities of developers and researchers who use and contribute to our tools each day
7. We provide our members and the community with the public and private infrastructure necessary to support distributed collaborative remote working, such as IRC channels, mailing lists, subversion repositories, Trac instances for ticket management and wikis, content management systems, blogs, live deployments with real end users for testing and regular feedback, etc.
8. We are hands on, supportive and keen to involve more talented people in projects we are really passionate about
9. We have a strong track history of mentoring new members and successfully delivering open source projects, tools and research that demonstrably benefit the community
10. The vast majority of our GSoC projects were delivered successfully and our students were happy, with a number of the tools created going on to become widely used within the security community
11. Students from GSoC have gone on to become active members of the honeynet community, including proposing project ideas for future GSoCs or offering to be project mentors and organization administrators (so we can't be too unpleasant a bunch to get involved with!) ;-)
12. We have ex-GSoC students actively serving on our Board of Directors and in Executive Officer positions, so GSoC has definitely proven to be a great career path for students wanting to get more involved in open source and information security R&D.
13. Honeypots and honeynet technology, research and tools have filtered down benefits to many areas of IT, web development, operational service management, Internet education and computer security research

### Other ways to get involved

[GSoC](//summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is not the only way you can become involved in the with honeynet technologies and open source software - check out our [current](//www.honeynet.org/challenges) or [historic](//old.honeynet.org/misc/chall.html)series of [forensic challenges](//www.honeynet.org/challenges). Or learn more about the practical, real world application of honeynet technology in our popular series of ["Know Your Enemy"](//www.honeynet.org/papers) whitepapers, which now include projects and tools output from previous GSoCs students or mentors such as [PicViz](//www.honeynet.org/node/499), [Glastopf](//www.honeynet.org/papers/KYT_glastopf), [Qebek](//www.honeynet.org/papers/KYT_qebek) or [Conficker](//www.honeynet.org/papers/conficker).
