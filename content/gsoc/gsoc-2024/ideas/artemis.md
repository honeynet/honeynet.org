Artemis is a modular vulnerability scanner that checks various aspects of website security and builds easy-to-read messages to send to organizations to get the vulnerabilities fixed.
Multiple national-level CSIRTs use it to improve the security of their constituencies.

The goal of this project is to:

* research what existing tools to add to the Artemis scanning pipeline,
* extend Artemis with modules detecting different types of vulnerabilities,
* improve Artemis in other aspects: performance, UI, etc.

The primary required skill is Python programming and a familiarity with the Linux environment. Skill with web security topics is also desired.
