Honeyscanner is a vulnerability analyzer for honeypots designed to automatically attack a given honeypot, in order to determine if the honeypot is vulnerable to specific types of cyber attacks.

Honeyscanner uses a variety of attacks, ranging from exploiting vulnerable software libraries to DoS, and fuzzing attacks. The analyzer then provides an evaluation report to the honeypot administrator, offering advice on how to enhance the security of the honeypot. Targeted toward security enthusiasts, open-source communities, and companies, Honeyscanner provides a much needed safety check for various honeypots.

This project aims at improving the code base, add new attacks to the Honeyscanner arsenal, as well as add support for more honeypots.
