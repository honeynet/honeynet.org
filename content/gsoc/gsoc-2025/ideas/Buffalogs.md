BuffaLogs currently supports data ingestion exclusively from Elasticsearch. To enhance its functionality and versatility, we are expanding the system to accommodate multiple data sources.

### Project Objectives:
Developing connectors for one or more of the following sources, depending on the project timeline:

* Relational Databases (MySQL, Postgres, etc.)
* File-based Data Sources (CSV, JSON)
* AWS CloudTrail Logs
* Additional sources to be considered based on project scope

### Technical Requirements:

* Develop modular and maintainable Python code for each implemented connector
* Create comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
* Provide detailed documentation
