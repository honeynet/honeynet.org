BuffaLogs currently does not support alert notification. We are expanding the system to allow alert be sent to various destinations.

### Project Objectives:
Developing alert notifications for one or more of the following sources, depending on the project timeline:

* Email
* Http request
* Slack
* Additional sources to be considered based on project scope

### Technical Requirements:

* Develop modular and maintainable Python code for each implemented connector
* Create comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
* Provide detailed documentation
