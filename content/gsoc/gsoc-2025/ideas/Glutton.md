Glutton is a powerful **Generic Low Interaction Honeypot** designed to emulate various network services and capture malicious activity for security analysis. Its strength lies in its generic nature, supporting a wide range of network protocols.

The goal of this project is to:

* Develop a Go wrapper to integrate [Spicy](https://github.com/zeek/spicy) with Glutton.
* Implement protocol parsers for HTTP and DNS as initial examples.
* Provide documentation to explain the implementation.

The primary required skill is proficiency in Go programming and familiarity with Linux networking.  
An understanding of network monitoring tools like Spicy or similar is a nice-to-have skill.
