Right now we have a lot of [Analyzers](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#analyzers) implemented in IntelOwl.

But they are not enough! They are one of the core parts of the application so we want to add even more of them!!!! :)

This project aims to increment the number of available Analyzers and adjusting the old ones that are not working anymore as intended. We have about [10 different Analyzers that has been requested by the community members in Github](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anew_analyzer+) and are still not implemented. Plus we have other analyzers that requires intervention, like Yara, YETI, DNS Detectors and so on.

Plus, we would like this project to carry additional non-Analyzer related work, like the addition of new Ingestors or Playbooks for instance, which are pretty similar components.

Another optional and very different task could be to add support for [Podman](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/issues/2393) for the overall project as an alternative of Docker. This would require working more with the documentation and the core parts of the projects.

The ideal candidate for this project is someone who understand how IntelOwl's framework works and already tried to implement some Analyzers.
