Artemis is a modular vulnerability scanner that checks multiple aspects of website security and builds easy-to-read messages to send to organizations to get the vulnerabilities fixed.
Multiple national-level CSIRTs use it to improve the security of their constituencies - for example, since 2023, CERT PL has used Artemis to find and report more than half a million vulnerabilities.

The goal of this project is to:  

* Extend Artemis with modules detecting new types of vulnerabilities (for example, by integrating existing open-source tools),
* Improve Artemis in other aspects such as performance, UI, etc.

The primary required skills are Python programming and familiarity with Linux and Docker. Familiarity with web security topics is also desired.
