Right now we have a lot of [Analyzers](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage.html#analyzers) implemented in IntelOwl.

But they are not enough! They are the core part of the application so we want to add even more of them!!!! :)

This project aims to increment the number of available Analyzers. We have about [50 different Analyzers that has been requested by the community members in Github](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anew_analyzer+) and are still not implemented. We obviously do not ask to implement all of them but a reasonable amount of them based on the available time and the efforts required for each of them.

Adding a new Analyzer to the framework is one of the easiest things that can be done in this project. Once you get used to it, adding more of them is even easier!

The ideal candidate for this project is someone who understand how IntelOwl's framework works and already tried to implement an Analyzer.
