SweetCam is an open-source honeypot designed to emulate IP camera behaviors with minimal setup while offering robust modularity for extending functionality. It is built to support the emulation of key protocols commonly used by IP cameras, including SSH, RTSP, and HTTP.
A distinguishing feature of SweetCam is its ability to create a realistic web interface resembling an IP cameraâ€™s dashboard. This includes a login page and a simulated camera interface that can be customized using user-defined 360-degree video streams and images, making it highly adaptable to various use cases.
The modular architecture of SweetCam ensures flexibility, allowing users to easily integrate support for new camera models and configurations. By providing a realistic medium-interaction environment, SweetCam effectively lures and studies attackers targeting IP cameras, offering valuable insights for cybersecurity research and network defense strategies.
