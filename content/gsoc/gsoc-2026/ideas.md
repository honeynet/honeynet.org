### GSoC and The Honeynet Project

During the previous years of GSoC, the Honeynet Project's students have created a wide range of very successful open source security projects, many of which have gone on to become the industry standard open source tools in their respective fields.

We are also always interested in hearing any ideas for additional relevant computer security and honeynet-related R&D projects (although remember that to qualify for receiving GSoC funding from Google your project deliverables need to fit in to [GSoC's project timescales](//developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)!). If you have a suitable and interesting project, we will always try and find the right resources to mentor it and support you.

Please note - even if you aren't an [eligible GSoC participant](//developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq), we are also always looking for general volunteers who are enthusiastic and interested in getting involved in honeynet R&D.

Each sponsored GSoC 2026 project will have one or more mentors available to provide a guaranteed contact point to students, plus one or more technical advisors to help applicants with the technical direction and delivery of the project (often the original author of a tool or its current maintainer, and usually someone recognized as an international expert in their particular field). Our Google Summer of Code organizational administrators will also be available to all sponsored GSoC students for general advice and logistical support. We'll also provide hosting for project infrastructure, if required.

For all questions about the Honeynet Project, the GSoC program or our projects, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/68B8Ru5fSU) (preferred)** or email us at [project@honeynet.org](mailto:project@honeynet.org). You can also find us in [Slack](https://gsoc-slack.honeynet.org/).

**Application template**

If you are considering applying to participate with us in GSoC 2026 please find our [application template here]({{< ref "application.md" >}}). Use it when you are preparing your application on the official GSoC site and don't hesitate to ask your mentors for feedback before submitting!
