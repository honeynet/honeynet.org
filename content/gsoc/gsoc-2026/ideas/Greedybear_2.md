### Project Overview
The GreedyBear dashboard currently displays statistics through hard coded chart components and has a fixed layout. It would benefit the project to refactor the dashboard into a flexible, configuration-driven widget system that allows easy addition and removal of dashboard components.

### Goal
Have a configuration-driven dashboard where widgets can be added or removed by editing a single configuration file, or even better, directly in the frontend for admin users.

### Required Skills
* basic knowledge of JavaScript, preferably also of React and chart libraries
* motivation to design and implement and test substantial changes to an already existing frontend
