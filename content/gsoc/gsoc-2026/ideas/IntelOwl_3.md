### Project Overview
A core strength of our platform is its ability to communicate with the broader security ecosystem. We are looking for a contributor to lead the revitalization of our "Connectors"—the vital bridges used to export and share analysis reports with external platforms.

The focus will be on ensuring seamless interoperability with industry-standard tools, specifically MISP, Yeti, and OpenCTI.

### Key Objectives
* Comprehensive Connector Audit: Review the existing codebase for our primary connectors to identify, reproduce, and resolve reported bugs and performance bottlenecks.

* Infrastructure Setup & Debugging: Deploy and configure local instances of the relevant open-source projects (MISP, Yeti, OpenCTI) to create a robust testing environment for end-to-end debugging.

* Native Health Check Integration: Enhance user experience by implementing dedicated "Health Check" features. By utilizing the native APIs of external tools, you will build a diagnostic layer that allows users to instantly verify the status of their integrations.

* Future-Proofing: Refactor existing integration logic to make future updates easier to manage as external API schemas evolve.

### Contributor Profile
The ideal candidate for this project enjoys digging into third-party documentation and has a passion for building reliable, interconnected systems. You will play a crucial role in improving the reliability of the platform for our entire user base.

#### Key expectations include:

* Technical Research: Deep-diving into external API specifications.

* Environment Orchestration: Willingness to set up and manage the open-source tools required for testing.

* Proactive Communication: Working closely with mentors to standardize how data is mapped between platforms.
