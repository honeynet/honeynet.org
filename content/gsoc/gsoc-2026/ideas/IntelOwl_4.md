### Project Overview
The Advanced Search feature is the core engine for data discovery within IntelOwl. However, it currently requires critical maintenance and a user-experience overhaul. We are seeking a contributor to troubleshoot existing functional regressions and redesign the search workflow to make it more powerful and intuitive for security analysts.

This project offers a deep dive into Elasticsearch and provides a high-impact opportunity to improve how users interact with massive datasets of threat intelligence.

### Key Objectives
* Bug Remediation & Stability: Analyze and resolve current issues within the Advanced Search section (referenced in our bug reports) to restore full functionality.

* Elasticsearch Optimization: Audit and refine the interaction between the IntelOwl backend and the Elasticsearch cluster to ensure queries are fast and reliable.

* UI/UX Enhancement: Beyond fixing what is broken, you will work on improving the usability of the search interface—making it easier for users to build complex queries and filter results effectively.

* Performance Tuning: Identify and address bottlenecks in data retrieval to ensure the search remains responsive even as the database grows.

### Contributor Profile
This project is ideal for someone who enjoys the intersection of Backend Architecture and User Experience.

We are looking for:

* Elasticsearch Proficiency: Comfort working with search indices, mapping, and complex query structures.

* Analytical Problem-Solving: The ability to trace bugs from the frontend interface down to the database layer.

* Detail-Oriented Mindset: A focus on creating a polished, user-centric interface that simplifies complex data exploration.
