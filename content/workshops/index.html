        The members of the Honeynet Project have been getting together for annual workshops since the early days.
        Those were private invite-only workshops during which members got together, exchanged ideas,
        coded and hashed out collaborative efforts for the next year.
    </p>

    <p>
        Starting with our workshop in 2011, we have started to hold a security workshop for the public that
        consisted of presentations and hands-on exercises.
        This page contains links to our past public security workshops with links to presentations and videos.
        Enjoy!
